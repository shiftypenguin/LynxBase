Simple Stupid file & device shredder

Derived from tfcrypt with idea of using threefish for fast shredding
Build without -DSHRED_FAST64 if you want read bytes always from urandom
(with SHRED_FAST64, urandom used only for dice and once for key seeding)

I found this tool useful, but it existed only in gnu coreutils, and nowhere. Busybox also misses it, but I did not
wanted to install coreutils on my musl sane systems, so I needed one and decided to write my own quickly.

Do not expect it to be clean, fast and bug-free. It just works for me. Code is ugly.
